# Face_Recognition
This Face Recognition System is a Python-based project using OpenCV for real-time face detection and recognition. It captures face images, stores them in a dataset, trains a model using OpenCVâ€™s LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm, and recognizes faces from a live video stream. The project consists of scripts for dataset collection (dataset.py), model training (training.py), and real-time recognition (detection.py). To run the project, install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt, collect face images, train the model, and then run the recognition script. This system can be further enhanced with deep learning models for improved accuracy and real-world applications like security systems and biometric authentication.
